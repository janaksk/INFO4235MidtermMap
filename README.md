## Running locally:

If trying to run locally, simply donwnload the repository and just need to boot it as a webserver. For example, heres the easiest way (with python): in terminal, CD to the directory of the project, then just start a local server

```
cd C:\PATHTOPROJECT

python -m http.server 8000
```

Then on your browser, you would open:

```

http://localhost:8000/index.html

```
